export const ABSTRACT_TEXT = "This paper presents Adaptive Quantum-Enhanced Learning (AQEL), a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework designed to address critical challenges in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. AQEL integrates four adaptive components: Adaptive Quantum Feature Mapping (AQFM), a Noise-Aware Variational Quantum Circuit (NAVQC), a Classical Meta-Optimizer with Quantum Feedback (CMO-QF), and a Secure Scalable Data Interface (SSDI). Unlike static hybrid approaches, AQEL is designed to dynamically adapt its quantum architecture based on performance metrics and gradient behavior. We evaluate the framework's effectiveness on a benchmark binary classification task via high-fidelity simulation. The results demonstrate high classification accuracy, with the model automatically adapting its circuit depth during training to navigate the expressibility-trainability trade-off. Comprehensive ablation studies and a simulated noise resilience analysis validate the potential of AQEL's adaptive components, indicating its promise for developing robust QML applications.";
